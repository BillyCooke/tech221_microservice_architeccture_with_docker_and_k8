# Kubernetes

## What is Kubernetes
Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source container orchestration system for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.

## When not to use K8?
* Can be overkill if you do not need high availability
* If your app is monolothic as K8 breaks down into smaller services
* It is difficult to learn and master so may take up too much time and resources
* Expensive as there are a lot of resources required as a minimum

## How does it work?
It orchestartes containerized applications to run on a cluster of hosts. K8 automates the deployment and management of applications using infrastructure.

It works by creating pods and services. A pod is a group of one or more containers that are dedployed together and share a network and IP.

## Benefits
* Faster deployment as everything needed is in one container
* Automation of deployment
* More efficient due to automation
* Multi-cloud capability - you can spread your workload
* Cheaper than alternatives
* Runs applications with greater stability
